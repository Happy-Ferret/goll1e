h1. What is it?

I have started implementing a HAML processor in the GO language.
You can find out more about HAML at "haml-lang.com":haml-lang.com.
You can find out more about GO at "golang.org":golang.org.

I've tried to remain diligent about reproducing the output from the canonical Ruby-based parser, so if you feel familiar with the one, then you should feel familiar with the other.

h1. Is it done?

Well, getting closer to something useful. The *gohaml* parser now supports the following:

* Tags with
** empty content;
** attributes of the form @{:attr => "value"}@;
** id moniker using "#" (@#divId@); and,
** class moniker using "." (@.divClass@).
* Tag nesting
* Simple lookup
* Engine-level autoclose option (@&lt;br /&gt;@ vs. @&lt;br&gt;@)
* Tag-specific close option (@%br/@ becomes @&lt;br /&gt;@ regardless of autoclose setting)
* Whitespace removal with the @<@ operator

This parser hasn't the same level of error reporting as the Ruby-based parser. That, of course, comes next. I want to make sure that I have the same reporting style and type of messages that comes with the other parser.

-No. Not even close. I just started yesterday with a language I just found out existed three days ago. However, in just that little time, I feel like I've come pretty far.-

h1. How can I install this?

Just follow the simple directions from the command line:

pre. git clone git://github.com/realistschuckle/gohaml.git gohaml
cd gohaml
make install

h1. How can I use it?

How about something like this? Save it, compile it, link it, and run it!

bc.. package main

import (
	"gohaml"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var scope = make(map[string]interface{})
	scope["lang"] = "HAML"
	content := "I love <\n=lang<\n!"
	engine := gohaml.NewEngine(content)
	output := engine.Render(scope)
	fmt.Println(output) // Prints "I love HAML!"
}
