h1. What is it?

I have started implementing a HAML processor in the GO language.
You can find out more about HAML at "haml-lang.com":haml-lang.com.
You can find out more about GO at "golang.org":golang.org.

h1. Is it done?

No. Not even close. I just started yesterday with a language I just
found out existed three days ago. However, in just that little time,
I feel like I've come pretty far.

h1. How can I install this?

Just follow the simple directions from the command line:

pre. git clone git://github.com/realistschuckle/gohaml.git gohaml
cd gohaml
make install


h1. How can I use it?

How about something like this? Save it, compile it, link it, and run it!

bc.. package main

import (
	"gohaml"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var scope = make(map[string]interface{})
	scope["lang"] = "HAML"
	content := "I love<\n =lang<\n!"
	engine := gohaml.NewEngine(content)
	output := engine.render(scope)
	fmt.Println(output) // Prints "I love HAML!"
}
