h1. What is it?

I have implemented an LL(1) parser generator for the Go programming language. I did this to build parse trees for my HAML parser.
You can find out more about LL(1) parsers at "LL Parser":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser (Wikipedia)
You can find out more about GO at "golang.org":http://golang.org

h1. Is it done?

For a first draft, yes, I think so. Features include:

* Yacc-like input grammar files
** Ad-Hoc Syntax Directed Translations
** Custom type handling with yystype, %token-, and %type declarations
* "Dev" mode to emit printing instructions for the generated parser
* Package setting
* Sample input.y file with the expected command-line calculator grammar with operator precedence

h1. How can I install this?

Just follow the simple directions from the command line:

pre. git clone git://github.com/realistschuckle/goll1e.git goll1e
cd goll1e
make install

h1. How can I test this out?

Just follow the simple directions from the command line:

pre. git clone git://github.com/realistschuckle/goll1e.git goll1e
cd goll1e
make gen
test/test
1 * 2 + 3 / 4 - 5

h1. How can I use it?

Create a grammar file, run goll1e against it, and include that .go file in your project. The command syntax goes something like @goll1e input.y output.go@.

h1. Can I type to goll1e on stdin?

Yep. And, it'll print to standard out, too. Just type @goll1e@ at the command prompt after installation and you can type all you want with a CTRL+D to signal EOF.
